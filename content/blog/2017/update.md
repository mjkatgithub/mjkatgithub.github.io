# update

It's been a long time since I posted anything here. Nothing happened since 2014! That should change now. I'll integrate tags in the near future and continue to post this and that, but focus on some highlights. Well, and hopefully I'll add the social media links soon. ;-)

## Webdevelopment

Speaking about several technologies, some Ideas I have for awesome projects in the future and Web Development in general. For more fun I’ll also add some basic syntax highlighting.

## Bushcraft / Survival / Prepping

I think I'll share some Survival / Bushcraft skills with you and maybe make some tutorials. Maybe I'll also show some pictures of my equipment an speak about my experience with it.

## Making Music

You know / or you don't, I'm a musician so of corse I planed to write about making music.
