Its christmas time so i have time to code. Nuxt 3 reaches its end of life in january 2026 and nuxt 4 is the new kid on the block. So i decided to upgrade my project to nuxt 4. And since my blog is already configured to be Nuxt 4 ready and its just a simple blog with some markdown files, it should be a no-brainer right?

## prepare the project

## update the dependencies

## update the config
