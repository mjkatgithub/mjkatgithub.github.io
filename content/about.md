# About

## About me

Hello, I'm Melchior. I was born in Hamburg and currently live in Hanover. I'm a full stack developer and very grateful that I was able to turn my hobby into a career.

Furthermore, I am a passionate musician. For example, I play in the reggae band [peace development crew](http://www.peacedevelopmentcrew.de){:target="_blank"} or make electronic music both on the computer and with hardware like Electribe by Korg. My artist name is [ras 'or](http://www.ras-or.com){:target="_blank"}

I also like cycling (I have recorded some tours and uploaded them to [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@MelchiorKannengieer){:target="_blank"}) and am interested in all kinds of outdoor activities such as hiking, climbing, but also survival and bushcraft.

Oh... and I like video games... maybe I'll record that at some point and upload it to YouTube.

## About this blog

In the past I posted various things on this blog, but decided to focus more on technical post. However, this does not mean that there is not something else to read here. I have also decided to write my posts in English in the future. Have fun reading my posts. They may also be useful for one or the other, even if I am now primarily writing them for myself in order to deepen topics.

## Contact

The easiest way to get in touch with me is via [matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@mkaatmtrx:matrix.org){:target="_blank"} or my [discord server](https://discord.gg/ZsKEmD22gt){:target="_blank"}.

if you want to send me something old-fashioned like an email, first of all you should know that it can easily get lost in my mailbox and secondly please use my [pgp key](http://downloads.mjkatweb.de/Melchior%20Kannengiesser@gmx.de%20melchior.kannengiesser@gmx.de%20%280x9DA550DE%29%20pub.asc){:target="_blank"}

## donations / gifts

Well, at the moment there isn't really a way to donate, but if you want to support me you can buy me something from my [discogs](http://www.discogs.com/wantlist?user=ras-or){:target="_blank"} or my [amazon](https://www.amazon.de/hz/wishlist/ls/27M80R0N4QZP1?ref_=list_d_wl_lfu_nav_1){:target="_blank"} wishlist or give the amazing Brave browser a try.
